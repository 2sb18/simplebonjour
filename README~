simplebonjour

this is a simple pure-data external that enables support for
the bonjour zeroconf implementation within a user's patch.

INSTALL:
make sure to edit makefile with the location of your pd's sources
install bonjour support for your operating system (specifically dns_sd.h)
$ make
make sure simplebonjour is in pd's startup path

OPERATION:
simplebonjour is extremely simple.  

it will allow you to do two things:
find available services of specific type
resolve discovered services

send a message containing "browse _yourservice._type" to the object's inlet.  shortly all discovered services will be output as symbols thru right outlet. send a message containing "resolve your-servicename" to the object's inlet.  shortly a float containing the service's port number will output from simplebonjour's left outlet.  then continue to configure remaining ports and prefixes in pure-data!
